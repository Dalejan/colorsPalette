## Key Features

- Machine learning unsupervised clustering
  - Thanks to k-means algorithm we can cluster the colors and select the most representatives
  - This could have been done with an histogram, but where is the fun on that?
- Pyscript proxy with javascript events
  - Pyscript allows the communication between js and python by proxies and specific attributes.

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Dalejan/colorsPalette.git

$ cd colorsPalette

# To correctly serve these files locally you must use http.server or similars
$ python -m http.server

```

Once the app is on you can go to `http://localhost:8000` and play around.

> **Note**
> The use of http.server is necessary for this project due to the modular file structure
